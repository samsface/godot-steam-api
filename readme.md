# Godot-Steam-API 💨

> **Godot Steam integration using GDNative.** Supports 💰Windows, 🐧Linux & 🍏MacOS (x86_x64/arm64).

# Getting Started
1. Download and open this [example project](https://github.com/samsface/godot-steam-api/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). Or download through Godot using the [Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1020).
3. There will be a SteamAPI tab in the Project Settings, follow the instructions to configure the SteamAPI for your game.

The path for the SDK needs to be the root directory of the Steam SDK (the folder containing the README file).

Now you can use the following functions:
```gdscript
Steam.set_achievement("gator_god")
Steam.get_achievement("gator_god")
Steam.clear_achievement("gator_god")
Steam.set_leaderboard_score("High Scores", 1000)
var scores = yield(Steam.get_leaderboard_scores("High Scores", 0, 10), "done")
```

## Buildling localy on Windows

1. Clone this repo.
  ``` sh
  git clone git@github.com:samsface/godot-steam-api.git
  ```

2. Download and install:
    - https://cmake.org/download
    - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads (community edition is fine)
    - https://www.python.org/downloads (download Python3 if you just have 2.7)

3. Install Conan, a C++ package manager.
    ``` sh
    pip3 install conan
    ```

4. Download the [Steam SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/steamworks_sdk_152.zip) and extract it into the lib directory were you cloned this project.
    > If your files are now laid out like this: `godot-steam-api/lib/steam-sdk/redistributable_bin/win64/steam_api64.dll`; you've done it correctly. 

5. Generate the Visual Studio project.
    ```sh
    # in root directory were you cloned this project to, e.g. C:/work/godot-steam-api
    mkdir work && cd work && cmake .. && start .
    ```

6. Open `steamsdk-godot.sln` and build. CMake will install the built dlls into the example project for you every time you build. Just open the example project and your good. The library is also reloadable so no need to restart Godot every build.
